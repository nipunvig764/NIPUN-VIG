                <h2><i>Hi! My name is Nipun Vig,i am a student, persuing Btech from Jmit Radaur(yamunanagar) in computer science branch.At present(2018) i am in 3rd year.I started programming with C language in very orthodox fashion as everyone around told me that it is a basic language that you must know but honestly speaking i never found c language interesting and my confidence started falling and i started thinking whether i would be able to do anything..But i kept on trying and it is well said "Fortune favours the brave " then at a low pace i got interested in web development and then i started learning Html,Css,javascript and Bootstrap and i also started backend development with django which just deviated me from front-end development.But i am back to it with my first website .. </i></h2>
